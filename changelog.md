- Added an argument parser with the following optional arguments: 
    - "no_enchant": Disables script enchant usage.
    - "shimmy": Enables automatic keyboard presses between battles. This will increase farming speed but will make it unsafe to switch tabs while it is running.
    - "timer": Flag to set a value (in seconds) to automatically stop the script after a set amount of time.

    Functionality for these arguments has also been implemented.
